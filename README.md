The aim of this article is to shed light upon how employment and GDP trends have changed over the years. We have analized different sectors of the economy and found out how the importance of each of them have been growing or decreasing in terms of the the jobs and wealth they create.

The data was obtained in the World Bank Global Jobs Indicators Database (JoIn), available in the website https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/global-jobs-indicators-database. It includes data from 169 countries in the last three decades.
